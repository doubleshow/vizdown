Let's look at what we can learn about Amazonian Motmot.

```
filterBy('COMMON NAME', 'Amazonian Motmot')
show()
```

There are tons of fields. We are only interested in the locations in which these birds are observed and how many were counted during each observation.

```
select(['COMMON NAME','LOCALITY','OBSERVATION COUNT'])
show()
```

Let's group these observations by localtions. The relevant field is _LOCALITY_.

```
groupBy('LOCALITY')
show()
```

We found six observations were made in Pousada EcolÃ´gica Rancho Grande and only one was made in Rio Verde to Porto Velho. 

In each observation, there may be anywhere from one bird or thousands of birds in a flock seen by an observation. Such information is stored in _OBSERVATION_COUNT_. Let's sum up the numbers under the _OBSERVATION_COUNT_ column to find out how many birds in total observed in each location.

```
sum('OBSERVATION COUNT')
show()
```

Finally, we take a total sum to find out in total how many birds were counted across all locations.

```
sum('sum-observation-count')
show()
```

The answer is 15.
